## Summary

- Value investment, in the end, is also a pattern. It's fundamentally no different from technical analysis.

- If investment is based on patterns, let's think probabilistically and statistically, and manage risk by adjusting our betting amount.

- If not, let's invest with the concept of 'equity', the essence of stocks.

- If both seem unmanageable, let's develop an investment artificial intelligence.

- If that doesn't seem right either, it's best to be satisfied with the bank's interest rate. Or, study hard to increase your own value.

## Introduction

Studying various things seems to broaden my horizons and allows me to think diversely. Although I'm currently indifferent to becoming rich and don't directly invest in stocks, I have gained confidence in my investment methods. Here are my thoughts.

It's been a while since I lost interest in direct investment. My value of life has changed significantly, and **I thought that trading for a short-term price difference might be a gamble if it's impossible to verify the possibility of profit probabilistically and statistically, no matter how solid logic one possesses.**

For instance, people usually expect the stock price to rise when the profits are high. But think about it, why should the stock price rise when the profits increase? Is the stock market a system that raises stock prices when profits rise? Absolutely not. Then, does all the profit go directly to the shareholders when the profit is high? This is also absolutely not the case. They don't give all the profits as dividends. So, why should the stock price rise? In fact, there's no reason. It just rises because many people buy it.

In the end, **the essence of stocks is supply and demand, and it's a game where you can avoid defeat by buying in advance before the demand increases.** But everyone's logic for thinking that demand will increase is different, which is why technical investment and value investment were created. These investment methods are ultimately a problem of 'interpretation of results'. Now, there are also people who try to forcibly increase demand, like the commonly mentioned 'forces' or 'stock price manipulation'. In fact, as long as they can increase demand after purchasing stocks, they won't lose. Of course, it would be a problem if it's illegal.

## The 'Real' Investment

Aside from the act of forcibly increasing the stock price, I think all the actions trying to interpret the movement of the stock price and predict its direction are ultimately about 'patterns'. Even value investment, which is considered a standard in investment, is one of the efforts to find patterns. Pursuing 'profit' is also a pattern about profit, and no matter what various valuation methods people talk about, it's essentially not different from technical investment because it's a story that 'stocks that had such a trend made a profit'. But the problem is, it's about proceeding on belief without statistical probability verification.

After studying quant and backtesting various strategies, what I felt was, of course, it's an obvious thing, but whether it's value investment or technical investment, I think it's hard to achieve a 100% win rate in the stock market if you invest based on 'patterns'. Because no one knows how supply and demand will change, how can I know who will buy my stock for what reason in the future? And even if I've been right 100 times so far, I could be wrong on the 101st time.

Of course, **I think there can be patterns that are correct about 6 times out of 10, even if not up to 100%. The important thing, however, is being aware of the risk of this investment method.** Whether it's a valuation method or technical analysis, if you're investing using a certain pattern in the end, I think you should invest managing risk and adjusting the betting amount, knowing that the win rate won't be 100%. Wouldn't a representative example be the Kelly Criterion?

**Otherwise, I think it's right to invest with the concept of ownership of the company, the essence of stocks.** The key is to buy the company when no one knows about it, when there's only potential, and just HODL hoping that the company won't go bankrupt until many people who find the company attractive appear. We can't predict why people who want to buy my company find my company attractive. It's just the buyer's mind. Can Tesla's early investors know why you bought Tesla?

**If you don't think this is it either, I think the only remaining method is to create an investment AI.** Anyway, AI friends will also find patterns in it, adjust weights, manage risk and invest in a way to maximize profits, but I think they can do it much better than people with emotions. **But if you even think you can't do this, then the bank is the answer.** If you think about it, banks are a grateful existence. They hedge the inflation of many people without doing anything. If there is someone who is not satisfied with this interest rate and wants to become rich, they can study hard and raise their own value.

## Conclusion

Some people may agree with this, and some may not. But at least for now, this is what I think. My perspectives on investing can change someday, but for now, I believe they are quite solid and close to the right answers.

If I find a bit more free time and grow a bit more technically, **I do want to create an investment AI someday.** But it wouldn't be for personal gain -- I'd want to create an AI that anyone can comfortably use, like ChatGPT. Not everyone can be wealthy, but wouldn't the number of people who lose money due to false information decrease? I would like to take on this challenge someday.

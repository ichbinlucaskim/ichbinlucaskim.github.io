Great to meet you. My name is **LUCAS KIM**. 

I strive to make the best possible decisions by thinking deeply, looking at problems from new perspectives, and approaching solutions logically.

My research interests include: ***Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning***. I am aspiring to solve real-world problems with data and these tools.

I am committed to continuous learning to achieve this, and I won’t stop sharing what I’ve learned to grow together with others.

If you are curious about my journey, please feel free to review my [Personal History](https://ichbinlucaskim.github.io/posts/personal-history) and [Curriculum Vitae](https://ichbinlucaskim.github.io/posts/curriculum-vitae).

Thank you :)
